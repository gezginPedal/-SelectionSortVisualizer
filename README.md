# SelectionSortVisualizer
In this project, i did visualized the swapping strategy of selection sort. 

To start off with, we'll need to bring in the selection sort algorithm code. 
Then, come up with an array of data and send that through the algorithm. 
For each iteration of the algorithm, display the current state of the array on the canvas, 
and then draw a line or arrow that shows the numbers being swapped.  

Once we've successfully displayed the array being sorted, 
create 3 more arrays and display them as well, in a quadrant on the canvas. 
Create one array with reverse sorted values, one array where a few values are the same, 
and one array where only one value is out of order.
